### README for GitHub Project: Florian贸polis Municipal Campaign Data Analysis

# Florian贸polis Municipal Campaign Data Analysis

This project provides an interactive exploratory analysis of the 2024 municipal election campaign data in Florian贸polis, Brazil. The data includes information on candidates, political parties, financial resources, and demographic characteristics. The main goal is to allow users to investigate the distribution of campaign resources, demographic representation, and financial contributions among candidates and parties.

## Project Overview

The app is built using **Streamlit**, **Pandas**, and **Plotly**, offering a user-friendly interface that visualizes key campaign metrics. Users can filter by political party and explore various data points, including:

- Candidate demographics (age, gender, race, education level)
- Financial declarations, including the total assets declared by each candidate
- Campaign expenses and resources received
- A ranking of the top political parties by total campaign expenses
- Candidates who have run for office multiple times
- Candidates with the highest party fund contributions

## Features

1. **Party Selection**: Choose a political party from the sidebar to see detailed statistics specific to that party or select "Todos" (All) to view an overview of all parties.
2. **Demographic Distribution**: Charts illustrating the age, gender, race, and education level of the candidates.
3. **Financial Insights**: Explore declared assets, total expenses, and funds received by candidates and parties.
4. **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic and sortable bar charts, pie charts, and histograms powered by Plotly for seamless exploration.
5. **Top 5 Party Insights**: Special analysis on the parties with the largest contracted expenses.

## Requirements

To run this project locally, you need the following dependencies:

```bash
