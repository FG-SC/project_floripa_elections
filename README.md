# Municipal Campaign Analysis in Florianópolis

This project focuses on analyzing data from the municipal elections in Florianópolis. Using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Plotly**, the project explores candidate demographics, financial resources, and historical candidacy patterns. The data was collected from a CNN webpage and processed through a **Jupyter Notebook** that scrapes and prepares the data in a structured format.
